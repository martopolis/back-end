#this document is based on the cost estimation of website
#There are 3 major factors that actually matters are:
#1)process behind it
#2) team building it
#3) functionality and integrations



#The basic target should be running a page strength analysis at the very beginning
# Which is  followed by alexa ranking and traffic analysis
#Moreover traffic analysis should be carried out if the website is functional otherwise
#strong web development isnot proportional to the traffic (sensitive issue)
#Design is an important issue,to be involved while the cost is estimated.

#The saber metrics way:
#weighing each of the criteria is an important aspect as to simplify our decision making
#Solution:
#Run an analysis over all websites of the same genre(eg:ecommerce,tutorial,social network etc)
#Analyzing how it performs and built in tech
#weigh out all the criteria then,
#proceed with saber metrics
#calculate the points for the websites involved


#Note: it is important to carefully prioritize every criteria (weighing them out carefully)
